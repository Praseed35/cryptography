### Audio Encryption & Decryption using AES and RSA Algorithms
This project demonstrates a simple web application for encrypting and decrypting audio files using Python with Flask and the PyCrypto library for encryption. It provides a user-friendly interface for uploading audio files, encrypting them with AES encryption, and decrypting them using RSA encryption.
## Features
# Encryption:
        Users can upload an audio file, which is then encrypted using AES encryption with a randomly generated key. The AES key is then encrypted using RSA encryption with a public key.
# Decryption: 
        Encrypted audio files can be uploaded along with the corresponding private key file, allowing users to decrypt the audio and download the decrypted version.
# Download Options: 
        Users can download the encrypted audio file and the private key for decryption.
