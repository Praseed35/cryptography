### Audio Encryption & Decryption using AES and RSA Algorithms
This project demonstrates a simple web application for encrypting and decrypting audio files using Python with Flask and the PyCrypto library for encryption. It provides a user-friendly interface for uploading audio files, encrypting them with AES encryption, and decrypting them using RSA encryption.
